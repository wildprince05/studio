# **App Name**: RailPilot

## Core Features:

- Conflict Detection: Detect potential train conflicts based on current schedules and real-time data feeds. The AI tool will use its reasoning to decide when or if a given piece of real-time information constitutes a possible future conflict, incorporating various relevant parameters (weather, route maintenance etc.) in its calculations.
- Schedule Visualization: Display train schedules and potential conflicts on an interactive map.
- Automated Re-scheduling: Generate optimal re-scheduling proposals to resolve conflicts, minimizing delays.
- Route Optimization: Suggest alternative routes for trains to avoid delays or conflicts. The AI tool will use its reasoning to decide when or if a given possible alternative route could offer an advantage given multiple variables.
- Alerting System: Notify relevant personnel about potential conflicts and re-scheduling proposals.
- Real-time Data Integration: Integrate real-time data from various sources (e.g., weather, track maintenance).
- User Preferences: Allow users to set preferences for re-scheduling (e.g., prioritize certain trains or routes).

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep blue (#3F51B5) to convey trust and reliability. The choice is based on a desire to create a safe, reliable atmosphere for such an important and timing sensitive software.
- Background color: Light gray (#F0F2F5) to provide a clean and professional look.
- Accent color: Orange (#FF9800) to highlight critical alerts and actions, an analogous color of deep blue with less saturation to indicate urgent but not alarming information.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter', a grotesque-style sans-serif known for its neutral, readable appearance.
- Use clear, consistent icons to represent train types, routes, and alerts.
- Prioritize a clean, map-centric layout that makes key information easily accessible.
- Subtle transitions to show updates, without distracting from critical information.
